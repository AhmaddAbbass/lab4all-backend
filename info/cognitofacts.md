Exactly!! üî• You're really getting it now. Here's a clean breakdown of what happens when you interact with **Cognito** in this setup:

---

### üîê What is Cognito doing behind the scenes?

When your **Lambda handler** (like `signup` or `login`) calls Cognito, here's what happens:

---

## ‚úÖ Login Flow with Cognito (USER\_PASSWORD\_AUTH):

### 1. **Your Lambda calls Cognito** via the SDK (`cognito.initiateAuth`)

You pass:

* `CLIENT_ID` ‚Üí identifies the **App Client** trying to do auth (no secret needed for server-side).
* `AuthFlow: USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`
* `AuthParameters` with:

  * `USERNAME` (usually email)
  * `PASSWORD`

---

### 2. **Cognito checks**:

* Is this `CLIENT_ID` valid for this **User Pool**?
* Is the **user with this email** registered?
* Is the **password correct**?

---

### 3. **If valid** ‚Üí Cognito responds with:

* ‚úÖ **Access token** (JWT)
* ‚úÖ **ID token** (JWT with identity info like `email`, `sub`)
* ‚úÖ **Refresh token** (to stay logged in later)

---

### 4. You return this token (especially Access Token) to the frontend

* On future requests (like `GET /profile`), the client includes:

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
  ```

---

### 5. **API Gateway** (via Cognito Authorizer) validates this token

* Confirms:

  * Token is signed by Cognito
  * Not expired
  * Belongs to the correct User Pool
* If valid ‚Üí lets the request hit the Lambda.

## üîÅ Summary

| Step             | Who does it?          | Purpose                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Login request    | Your Lambda (`login`) | Triggers `initiateAuth`              |
| Credential check | Cognito               | Validates email & password           |
| Token generation | Cognito               | Returns Access/ID/Refresh tokens     |
| Future request   | API Gateway           | Validates Access token               |
| Profile read     | Lambda (`profile`)    | Reads claims from token (e.g. email) |
