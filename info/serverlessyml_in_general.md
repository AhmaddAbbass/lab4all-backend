# üßæ What is `serverless.yml`?

In Serverless Framework projects written in **TypeScript or JavaScript**, the `serverless.yml` file is **the heart of your backend configuration**.

Think of it like your **deployment control panel** ‚Äî it tells AWS:

* what services/functions you‚Äôre deploying (like `signup`, `login`, `getOrders`, etc.)
* how each function should be triggered (e.g. via HTTP or schedule)
* what environment variables, permissions, regions, and plugins to use
* how to build and package the code (e.g. TypeScript compilation with `esbuild`)

Every feature you build ‚Äî from a simple login endpoint to a full-blown order management system ‚Äî gets **registered and wired up** through `serverless.yml`.

## üß† TL;DR: What each part means

| Section     | Purpose                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `service`   | Gives your backend a logical name                         |
| `provider`  | Tells Serverless where/how to deploy + global config      |
| `functions` | Lists all your Lambda endpoints and how they‚Äôre triggered |
| `plugins`   | Adds tooling like `esbuild` or local development mode     |
| `custom`    | Configure how those plugins behave                        |
| `package`   | Fine-tune what gets included/excluded when deploying      |



Great question, Ahmad. Let‚Äôs break down **why GPT gave you this exact `serverless.yml`**, line by line, based on what **you‚Äôre trying to build**: a **Cognito-authenticated backend** for Lab4All, using **Serverless Framework** with **TypeScript Lambdas**.

---

### üîß 1. `service: lab4all-auth`

This names your backend stack. It will prefix your deployed resources in AWS like:

```
lab4all-auth-dev-signup
lab4all-auth-dev-login
...
```

---

### üåç 2. `provider: ...`

This section configures your AWS Lambda environment:

```yaml
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs18.x         # You‚Äôre writing handlers in Node.js (compiled from TS)
  region: us-east-1           # Where your Lambdas will live (must match your Cognito region)
  environment:                # These will be injected into ALL handlers
    USER_POOL_ID: ...
    CLIENT_ID: ...
```

üß† So now, your handlers can do:

```ts
process.env.USER_POOL_ID
```

‚Äî to securely refer to your Cognito pool and client.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. `functions: ...`

You defined 3 key features so far:

| Function Name | Trigger               | AWS Resource                              | Purpose                                  |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `signup`      | `POST /auth/register` | Lambda + API Gateway                      | Registers a user in Cognito              |
| `login`       | `POST /auth/login`    | Lambda + API Gateway                      | Authenticates user, returns tokens       |
| `profile`     | `GET /auth/profile`   | Lambda + API Gateway + Cognito authorizer | Protected endpoint that reads JWT claims |

So GPT wrote:

```yaml
functions:
  signup:
    handler: dist/handlers/signup.signupHandler
    events:
      - http:
          path: auth/register
          method: post
          cors: true
```

‚úÖ That maps the **signup endpoint** to a TypeScript file that will be built into `dist/handlers/signup.js` and exposed via **API Gateway**.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è 4. `authorizer: COGNITO_USER_POOLS`

This line:

```yaml
authorizer:
  type: COGNITO_USER_POOLS
  userPoolArn: arn:aws:cognito-idp:us-east-1:${self:provider.environment.USER_POOL_ID}
```

means that:

* the `/auth/profile` endpoint is **protected**,
* API Gateway will **verify the AccessToken** (JWT) **before** calling your Lambda,
* and will inject claims (like `email`, `sub`, etc.) into the request context.

This saves you the trouble of doing manual JWT verification inside the function.

---

### üß© 5. `plugins: ...`

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-esbuild     # Compiles your TypeScript to JavaScript
  - serverless-offline     # Lets you run your API locally at http://localhost:3000
```

These two make your dev experience smooth:

* You can run `npx serverless offline` to simulate API Gateway + Lambda locally.
* You don‚Äôt have to precompile TypeScript‚Äîesbuild handles that when you deploy or test.

---

### üß† Summary

GPT gave you that exact `serverless.yml` because:

* You‚Äôre doing **Cognito-based auth**, so it injected the pool/client IDs.
* You have 3 endpoints (`signup`, `login`, `profile`), so it mapped them to handlers.
* You want `profile` to be protected, so it added the **Cognito Authorizer**.
* You‚Äôre using TypeScript, so it added `esbuild`.
* You want to test locally, so it added `serverless-offline`.

Let me know when you‚Äôre ready to:

* Add more functions (like `createClassroom`)
* Move to deploying it to AWS (`npx serverless deploy`)
* Or write the handlers themselves
